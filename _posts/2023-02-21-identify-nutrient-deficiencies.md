Teen Creates App To Identify Nutrient Deficiencies
High school student Rian Tiwari has developed a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to help pregnant people spot nutrient deficiencies by scanning their fingernails. Tiwariâ€™s app uses data from the scans to trigger diet and lifestyle recommendations, aiming to reduce the likelihood of a user developing anemia.

Preventing anemia can be as easy as eating iron-rich foods such as beans, red meat, and dried fruit.

Tiwari built an app that analyzes fingernail scans for signs of deficiencies in vitamin B12, calcium, zinc, and other nutrients. If these signs exist, the app recommends dietary and lifestyle changes, potentially preventing the development of anemia.

The app starts with a photo of a nail taken by a user. It then uses a device-based neural network to analyze the image and classify the nail as healthy or unhealthy.

Tiwari filed for a U.S. patent for his invention in 2021. He was granted a patent in Germany last year.

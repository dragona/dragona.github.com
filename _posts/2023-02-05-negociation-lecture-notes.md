- Position-based negotiation is the traditional approach where each party takes a fixed position.
- Interest-based negotiation, developed in the 1980s, focuses on identifying the underlying interests of each party and finding a solution that benefits both sides. 
"Do not ask what do you want, instead ask why do you want it?"
- Dividing the pie is referred to as distributive negotiation, while enlarging the pie is integrative negotiation.

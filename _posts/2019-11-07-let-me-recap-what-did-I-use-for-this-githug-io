title: My steps into building this IO page 
---

- Create the repository:
    - name the new repos ```github_account_name.io``` 
    - add a theme to the repos from the ```settings``` tab in github 
- Using bootstrap theme
    - Clone the Bootstrap 4 for Github on your local machine
    - Clone your newly created repository
    - By default, there should be two files in your cloned repository (not including the hidden files), remove them then drag and drop the content
    of the cloned project Bootstrap 4 for Github onto your repository
    - ```git add -A```, ```git commit -m "first commit""``` then push the update to your GitHub account
    
You may need to wait before the changes take effect when you visit your .io page. In the meantime, my next step was to change the theme.

title: Downloading audiobooks from youtube. 
---

Reading a book is something I started loving quite late, but yes, now I can't stop reading. When audiobooks are available,
I like using them while reading. Listening enables me to keep up with steady reading speed. Youtube is one of the places where I often go for finding audiobook records for some of the books I read. Having copies of the audiobook files on my phone is a valuable thing for me as I can listen to them when I walk, run, or stay on a bus. 
 
Here are the steps I take in getting the audiobook files from youtube:
 
- find the audiobook on youtube (and let us assume we have what we need there.)
- use [this script](https://github.com/dragona/audiobooks) for downloading the youtube content, then convert it into an mp3 if that was not the case. 


Notes:
    - I make use of google colab to run the script
    - The generated mp3 files are saved on my Google drive folder "audio".
    - The "audio" folder is synching live on my different devices (Phone and Laptop)

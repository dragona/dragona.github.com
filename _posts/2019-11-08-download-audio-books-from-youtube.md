title: Downloading audiobooks from youtube. 
---

I discovered my love for reading books relatively late in life, but now I can't put them down. I prefer to use audiobooks while reading, as listening allows me to maintain a steady pace. I often turn to YouTube to find audiobook recordings for the books I read. Having digital copies of the audiobooks on my phone is extremely convenient for me, as I can listen to them while walking, running, or commuting.
 

To obtain audiobook files from YouTube, I follow these steps:

Locate the desired audiobook on YouTube.
Use the audiobooks script to download the YouTube content and convert it to an MP3 file, if needed. 
[this script](https://github.com/dragona/audiobooks) 
Run the script on Google Colab.
Save the generated MP3 files to a Google Drive folder named "audio".
The "audio" folder is synced across my devices, including my phone and laptop.
Note: The above steps assume that the desired audiobook is available on YouTube."

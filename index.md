I initially wasn't considering creating a page like this on GitHub, but after reflecting on the various tasks and projects I've undertaken in the past that I've forgotten how to perform, I've realized the value in using this platform as a repository for my notes. By making it publicly available, I have the added convenience of being able to access it from anywhere.

However, I understand that not all information is suitable for public consumption. Hence, I will carefully filter the content I post and only include information that I believe is advisable to share with the general public.

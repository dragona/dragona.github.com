I was not considering having a page like this on GitHub but after thinking about the things I have done which I have forgotten how to do them as I need to do them again now,
I think I can use this platform for my notes, which will be accessible from everywhere. While it is publicly available,
I will try to filter the posted content and will consider only publishing things that are adviseable to the general public.
